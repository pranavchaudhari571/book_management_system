* Express.js Fundamentals: Understanding how to set up routes, handle HTTP requests, and manage middleware in Express.
* MySQL Integration: Connecting an Express application to a MySQL database and performing CRUD operations.
* EJS Templating: Using EJS to render dynamic content on the server side.
* Middleware Usage: Incorporating middleware like Body-Parser to handle form submissions.
* Project Structuring: Organizing files and structuring the project in a scalable way.
